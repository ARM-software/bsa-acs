# BSA-ACS Prebuilt Images

This repository previously hosted prebuilt images for the **BSA ACS** suite.

---

## Latest Prebuilt Images
The latest **BSA ACS prebuilt images** are now published under the [`sysarch-acs`](https://github.com/ARM-software/sysarch-acs) repository:

ðŸ‘‰ [sysarch-acs/prebuilt_images](https://github.com/ARM-software/sysarch-acs/tree/main/prebuilt_images)

Partners and users are encouraged to use the unified `sysarch-acs` prebuilt images for the most up-to-date and supported releases.

---

## Legacy BSA Prebuilt Images
Older prebuilt images for BSA are still preserved here for reference and backward compatibility:

ðŸ‘‰ [prebuilt_images](./prebuilt_images)

These legacy binaries reflect historical builds prior to the consolidation into `sysarch-acs`.

---

## Going Forward
- All **new ACS builds** will be integrated into the [sysarch-acs](https://github.com/ARM-software/sysarch-acs) repository.  
- Prebuilt images in this repository are **frozen** and will not be updated further.  
- For the most current ACS validation flows, please refer to the `sysarch-acs` repository and its unified prebuilt binaries.
